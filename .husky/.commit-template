#   - not capitalize the subject line
#   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   - Do not end the subject line with a period
#   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   - Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body.
#   - Don't forget footer
