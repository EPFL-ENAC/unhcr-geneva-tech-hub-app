# Optimization
- [ ] separate the ghg and shelter app in two apps for optimisation (maybe frontend first)
- [ ] upgrade from vue2 to vue3 if possible (big problem with vuetify vue3)
- [ ] Save the s3/blob documents 'reference/metadata' in the couchdb database while uploading/deleting
  - no reference possible should be duplicated in documents
- Don't call shelter app resources/json and db if on ghg app, and vice et versa
