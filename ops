The Volume is only used to know that the baseline and endline are comparing the same things. If not a warning should pop up.)\n4) Calculation is using the litres times and efficiency factor (kgCO2e/l) (REF_DIES_L or REF_G_L)\n\nPlease note that preferably the volume of trucks, km and other things should not be shown when the user clicks that they know the litres of fuel used. This is because those elements are not used in the calculation\n\nCase 2 (km known)\n1) User tells which fluid is to be trucked (water, wastewater or faecal sludge)\n2) User must provide the distance between the camp the water source (one-way for water pumping) or the distance between the camp and the treatment site (one-way for wastewater and faecal sludge). This distance will eventually be multiplied by 2 in the equation to get the roundtrip distance\n3) User must provide the Volume of water pumped (The Volume IS used in the calculation and used to know that the baseline and endline are comparing the same things. If not a warning should pop up.) If the fluid is marked as wastewater or faecal sludge, this amount should be multiplied by 0.85 because not all of the water pumped is converted into wastewater or faecal sludge. We assume that 15% is not converted and therefore not trucked.\n4) User must provide the Volume of the truck\n5) Calculation will take all of these three inputs to calculate the number of trucks and use the km to multiply by the emissions factor [kg CO2e/km] REF_WSH_D, REF_WSH_G\n\n\nENERGY/WASH\tREF_DIES_L\tEnergy - Electricity - Emissions Factor - Oil/Diesel [kg CO2e/l]\t2.724\nENERGY\tREF_EFF_DIES\tEnergy - Facilities - Estimated Fuel Consumption for Diesel Generator [L/kWh]\t0.267\nENERGY\tREF_RNW\tEnergy - Electricity - Solar Emissions Factor [-]\t0.000\nWASH\tREF_WSH_D\tWASH - Trucking - Emissions Factor - Diesel (up to 3.5 tonnes) [kg CO2e/km]\t0.250\nWASH\tREF_WSH_G\tWASH - Trucking - Emissions Factor - Gasoline (up to 3.5 tonnes) [kg CO2e/km]\t0.220\nWASH\tREF_G_L\tWASH - Trucking - Emissions Factor - Gasoline (100% mineral gasoline) [kg CO2e/l]\t2.340\nWASH\tREF_WW_FS\tWASH - Trucking - Water to Wastewater Conversion Factor [-]\t0.85","files":null}]}
