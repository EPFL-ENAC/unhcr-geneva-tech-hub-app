We will use the reference that is in the current Reference database. Please see the Excel attached which shows the updated Reference database and the equations. As we discussed on Monday, UNHCR would like to have the load % as an input. An equation to do this based on the Australian reference has been added. The default value for a 60% load has been put in the Reference database. Please let me know if you have any questions. Message me with Jabber at anytime.
