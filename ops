If you have already implemented it, no worries, otherwise, please do not waste the time.\n\nVery important: when implementing this new structure for litres used as the input, the inputs and outputs are much simpler:\n\n### Columns are :\n\n**Inputs column**\nTrucking Type (input)\nLitres used (input)\nType of Truck (Diesel/Petroleum) (input)\n\n**Calculated column**\nTotal co2 (output)\n\nPlease contact me with Jabber if you have any questions.\n\nThank you","files":null}]}
