We added a second baseline ( called Min BAU Kebri beyah) with its own affiliated inputs, but the results do not match the tool this time. For our reference case, as mentioned, it looks good. Yet I cannot see the reason of the discrepancy. I let you take a look at the excel, and maybe we also talk tomorrow on this when we meet. \n\nHi @Charlie Weil, thank you for the great updates on the tool. I have checked the third scenario, OK Max Baseline (excel file attached), and made a third administrator template on the app. The exact same problem there is as it was for the OK Min Baseline. I suggest the discrepancies are rooted in the rounded number of proportion (%), but to be checked. Thanks!\n\n[OK Min_Baseline1.1_v1.xlsx](https://github.com/EPFL-ENAC/unhcr-geneva-tech-hub-app/files/8871758/OK.Min_Baseline1.1_v1.xlsx)\n\n[OK Max_BAU.xlsx](https://github.com/EPFL-ENAC/unhcr-geneva-tech-hub-app/files/8871754/OK.Max_BAU.xlsx)","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1654788527,"nonce":"lIv2zICKy81Je+1MGFtTc44bn5E=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOGxS9Oc5LemgpzwAAAAGUD8q-"},"added":["feat"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1654788527,"nonce":"8g1pFgiR1YBRsOGEm4/MrigJUZE=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOGxS9Oc5LemgpzwAAAAGUD8rA"},"added":["energy"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1654788527,"nonce":"N4TMhFud56zCGDDvD6lx9IbIVtU=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOGxS9Oc5LemgpzwAAAAGUD8rD"},"added":["triage"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"timestamp":1667901381,"nonce":"R7ThLOci44cNg0z/KgMutC2NTuw=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOGxS9Oc5N5j9O","github-url":"https://github.com/EPFL-ENAC/unhcr-geneva-tech-hub-app/issues/20#issuecomment-1306935118"},"message":"@blueur @charlottegiseleweil I moved this issue to  milesone:Energy Intervention Extension.
