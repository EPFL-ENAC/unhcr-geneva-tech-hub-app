We added a second baseline ( called Min BAU Kebri beyah) with its own affiliated inputs, but the results do not match the tool this time. For our reference case, as mentioned, it looks good. Yet I cannot see the reason of the discrepancy. I let you take a look at the excel, and maybe we also talk tomorrow on this when we meet. \n\nHi @Charlie Weil, thank you for the great updates on the tool. I have checked the third scenario, OK Max Baseline (excel file attached), and made a third administrator template on the app. The exact same problem there is as it was for the OK Min Baseline. I suggest the discrepancies are rooted in the rounded number of proportion (%), but to be checked. Thanks!","files":null}]}
