I will be off tomorrow and Friday, but I have convened the specs to David who will keep working on implementation. \n\nNow that the results/graphs are integrated within each module - I propose to keep the main “Results” tab and turn it into “SUmmary”. We still need to design this tab - could you tell us what kind of information you would like to eventually see in this final “Summary” tab with the key results of each module for example ?\n\n---\nResponse from Prof.\n\n@Charlie Weil : Dear Charlie - Thank you for your message. regarding your question, I have already answer it in my excel files where a summary of the results is presented.","files":null}]}
