Then, for each material/colour, a different hue for each form (100%, 90%, 80%, etc.). \n\nThere are 23 materials, so 23 colours. We can use the colour as a type of legend, as you suggest - in the table and perhaps also in the habitat risks and recycling/reuse considerations.\n\nFor forms, steel has the most - 13 forms, if we identify each type of structural section separately, or 7 forms if we consolidate the 6 structural sections. I suggest we consolidate the structural section forms. So, max. 7 forms for steel: 100%, 85%, 70%, 55%, 40% and 25% hues.\n\nI'll do some work on photoshop to fix a colour palette then give you the hex code for each material.","files":null}]}
