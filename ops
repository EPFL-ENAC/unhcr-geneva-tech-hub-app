Please see the screenshot attached. Basically, we all agreed that anyone should be able to add in new assessments to an existing site. The assessments themselves should have the same users, thus limited access. This is normal for the field since assessment creators may change over the years. Different users can create different endlines over the years for instance. I hope this can be done. \n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111510926/185890936-d5b84623-dcb2-4c6f-b010-f55f73756db6.png)","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1661162148,"nonce":"zP4Xqdm7KJqH3MVDyk9tM96iMes=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOGxS9Oc5QDTCOzwAAAAGvBFUj"},"added":["ghg"],"removed":[]}]}
