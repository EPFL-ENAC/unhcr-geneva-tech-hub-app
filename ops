I don't know why we did not think of that earlier.\nTwo things though:\n1. The 'Other' in material already exist. But it's different since we can only have the KG option right now (because we manually set the embodied CO2 and water.\n2. It's not at the 'end' of the list, since the list is sorted in a kind of alphabetical order. maybe we can 'pre-pend' or append it to the list though. What do you think?\n\nAbout 1).\n- Do we merge the functionality (remove at the top level menu and keep it inside material) ?\n- Do we keep the embodied co2/water feature only for the kg part ?\n\nWhat do you think ?","files":null}]}
